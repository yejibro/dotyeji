# dotyeji

The dotyeji (.yeji) is a directory where I've been placing my scripts
and they were writing their data to. This folder contains also
a globalsettings.conf file, it stores variables used in my other scripts.
`~/.yeji/globalsettings.conf` is hardcoded in every script, but you can
specify different .yeji folder location in the config, so the rest of the
stuff will be in some other place.

My .yeji folder looks like this:

    ├── bin
    ├── config
    ├── db
    │   └── rosiedb
    ├── tmp
    └── usr
        └── bin


Sorry for this shitty documentation, I really think nobody is going to even
try to use these crappy scripts to shitpost on some internet forum. Thanks
for reading BTW.
